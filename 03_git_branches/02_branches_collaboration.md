## Branches for collaboration

Using branches for collaboration is somehow intrinsically tied (in my head) to making pull requests.
Writing a good document involves having someone review your work, especially while it is still in progress.
When you make a feature-specific branch, say `add-chapter-04`, you can then submit a pull request (even to yourself) and have your team members leave line-by-line comments as part of the review process.
Commit more changes and push them and merge when you’re ready.

The other aspect of collaboration also holds true: you can contribute to other projects by making appropriate branches and submitting pull requests.

**Note**: Authorea has its own collaboration options (including allowing you to `fork` a public document), but I find its GUI isn’t as powerful as GitHub’s.
Also, diffs don’t appear as nicely on Authorea.
