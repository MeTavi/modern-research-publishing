# Getting started

How many times have you looked at a document with two edits widely spaced in time, wondering what you had changed and why?
Unless you are using version-control software on your files, you probably have a whole bunch of files all called [“final” something or the other](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1531).
What you want to do, then, is to use some modern tools to streamline your workflow, preserve all changes you’ve made over time accompanied by meaningful comments from yourself to yourself and prepare a slick document for wide consumption.

Let’s start with getting to know what’s involved in doing so.
This tutorial assumes that you have some knowledge of [`git`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and GitHub even if you aren’t quite at “wizard” status yet.
You might also be familiar with markdown.
If you are not, check out [GitHub’s guide to mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Markdown has a fairly versatile syntax and you can convert `.md` files into HTML, `.odt` and even PDFs.

The two (presumably) new items introduced in this workflow are Authorea and Zenodo.
Authorea is one of several editors that provide a simple web-based GUI for you to work collaboratively with your documents.
Zenodo, developed at CERN, is an online repository that wants to capture the [long-tail of science](https://zenodo.org/faq).
We’ll take a look at both in fair detail in later chapters.

For now, make sure you have (1) a markdown-friendly text editor at hand, (2) have `git` installed on your computer, (3) have created an Authorea account linked to your GitHub account and associated with your CERN e-mail address, and (4) have created a Zenodo account also linked to your GitHub one.
